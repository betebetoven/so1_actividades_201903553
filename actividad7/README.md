## Overview

This document provides a detailed explanation of the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS), the default scheduler used in Linux systems. The report covers the following main sections:

- **Introduction**: An overview of CFS and its purpose.
- **Key Features of CFS**: Highlights the primary characteristics that differentiate CFS from other scheduling algorithms, including fair CPU distribution, use of a red-black tree structure, virtual time management, and handling of relative priorities.
- **Functionality of CFS**: Explanation of how CFS assigns execution times, manages context switching, selects processes, and enforces fair load distribution based on process weights.
- **Conclusion**: Summary of CFS's impact on system performance and efficiency.

## Document Structure

The document is organized with clear sections and includes examples of how CFS handles processes to maximize CPU efficiency while ensuring fair time allocation.

## Usage

The report is available as a PDF file, which can be submitted directly for academic purposes. Make sure to review the content to gain an understanding of CFS's role in Linux.
